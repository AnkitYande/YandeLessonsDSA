# Instructions  
This is a short and reletively easy unit to help refamiliarize youself with recusion. You will be graded based on completing all four parts of this assignment.

## 1. Learn
Choose **one** of the following:
1) Read about Recursion: https://codehs.gitbooks.io/apjava/content/Algorithms-and-Recursion/advanced-recursion.html
2) Watch a video on recursion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rLBeHD3xps


## 2. Practice
Choose **two** of the following to impliment:
1) **Multiplication**: Write a recursive function that multiplies two numbers. You can assume both numbers are non-negetive integers.
2) **Palidrome checker**: Given a string, recusively check if the string is a palidrome (same backward as forward, e.g., "madam" or "nursesrun")
3) **Reverse a string**: Given a string, recusively parse and return a rerversed form of the string.
4) **Fibonacci series**: Given a number n calculate the nth number of the Fibonacci series. (The fibonacci series is "0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ..." The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each future element is calculated by summing the prior two elements)
 

## 3. Apply
In this portion we will print out pascal's triangle. 

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it and the left and right most numbers are always 1:

To solve this problem recusively, fill in the pascal function provided that takes in a row and column. Based on the row an column, you can determine which values from the previous level you will need to use. Think carefully about what your base case will need to be.

## 4. Assess
