# Assignment: Array Manipulation Problems

## Objective:

In this assignment, you will solve a set of problems involving 1D arrays. The goal is to practice basic array manipulations and enhance your problem-solving skills.

## Problems:

### 1. Find the Biggest Element

**Problem:** Find the biggest element in an array.

**Description:**
Given an array of integers, find the element that has the highest value.

**Example:**

* Input: `[3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 3]`
* Output: `4`

---

### 2. Find the Missing Number

**Problem:** Given an array of size `n-1` containing numbers from `1` to `n`, find the missing number.

**Description:**
You are provided with an array of integers where each integer is in the range from `1` to `n`. One number is missing in the array. Write a function to find the missing number.

**Example:**

* Input: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`
* Output: `3`

---

### 3. Merge Two Sorted Arrays

**Problem:** Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

**Description:**
You are given two sorted arrays. Write a function to merge these arrays into a single sorted array.

**Example:**

* Input: `array1 = [1, 3, 5], array2 = [2, 4, 6]`
* Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`

---

### 4. Move Zeroes to the End

**Problem:** Move all zeroes to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the other elements.

**Description:**
Given an array of integers, move all zeroes to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the other elements.

**Example:**

* Input: `[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`
* Output: `[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`

---

### 5. Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
**Problem**: Find the maximum sum of a subarray with a fixed size k.
**Description**: Given an array of integers and an integer k, find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k.
Example:
* Input: array = `[2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], k = 3`
* Output: `9` (The subarray [5, 1, 3] has the maximum sum)

---

## Deliverables:

1. Implement the solution for each problem in Java.
2. Ensure your code is well-commented and includes a main method to test the functionality of each problem.
3. Submit your Java files with the implemented solutions.
